The ability to track animals accurately is critical for behavioral experiments. For video-based assays, this is often accomplished by manipulating environmental conditions to increase the contrast between the animal and the background in order to achieve proper foreground/background detection (segmentation). Modifying environmental conditions for experimental scalability opposes ethological relevance. The biobehavioral research community needs methods to monitor behaviors over long periods of time, under dynamic environmental conditions, and in animals that are genetically and behaviorally heterogeneous.   To address this need, we applied a state-of-the-art neural network-based tracker for single mice. We compare three different neural network architectures across visually diverse mice and different environmental conditions.
